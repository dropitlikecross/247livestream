24/7 Live Stream Project

This is a project to run a 24/7 live stream.

There is no GUI and everything is running using CLI in order to save on resources. The idea is to have multiple servers with different genres running off 1 central storage source. There is also 1 server set up to automatically update the music library.

These instructions are for me as a personal reference. Feel free to use it as a guide to figure out your own stream.

I used Ubuntu 18.04 to test and run everything.

At the time of writing this I am running the servers on Azure using Standard B2ms (2 vcpus, 8 GB memory). These were the lowest hardware settings I could run smoothly on.

Check out the [installation instructions](https://github.com/dropitlikecross/247livestream/blob/master/instructions.md) and follow along.
